# Lumina Supplemental

Lumina Supplemental is an additional DLL for lumina that provides access to data that cannot be provided by Lumina. It pulls information from Garland Tools's supplemental sheet and matches them against FFXIV's game data. Long term it will also pull data from Libra Eorzea.

Big thanks to NotAdam for making Lumina
